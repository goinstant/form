# Guides

Components are pre-made, customizable libraries and UI widgets that are built
on top of the GoInstant Platform. They're designed to make it as easy as
possible to add multi-user functionality into your apps. You don't need to know
a lot about how GoInstant works to start using components right away, but in
our examples you'll see platform-related code that you can dig into as well.

There are two types of components: widgets and integrations.

 - [Widgets](../index.md) are UI features that add multi-user functionality to your app.
Drop a widget in and you'll see functionality added instantly. An example is
our [User List](../user_list.md) component, which shows user presence inside your app.
 - Integrations (coming soon) help 'Goinstant-ify' common development frameworks.

Over time we'll add more components (widgets and eventually integrations with
popular web frameworks).

## Available Components

### Widgets

* [Form](../form.md): Instant real-time, multi-user forms showing you who is doing what
  inside a form and propagating the data.
* [User List](../user_list.md): Let people see who is working with them inside your app.
* [Notifications](../notifications.md): Real-time status updates inside your app about what people
  are doing.
* [Click](../click_indicator.md): See who clicks where inside your app.
* [Scroll](../scroll_indicator.md): See where people are scrolling and where they're positioned on a
  page.
* [User Colors](../user_colors.md): Assign colors to individual users that propagate through the UI
  widgets.

Components make it easier than ever to leverage the power of GoInstant's
platform to build real-time, multi-user applications. Check out a component to
see how they work!
